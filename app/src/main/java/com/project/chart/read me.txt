this package contrains three interfaces.  

I use abstract factory pattern to create every object, and use fascade pattern to construct the relationship of these objects.

Factorys implement the interface IChartFactory.

each factory contains two products, i.e. Renderer and Dataset.

Renderer extends an abstract class "AbstractChartRenderer", whick implements the interface of IRenderer.

Dataset implements the interface of IDataSet.
